I conducted a comprehensive HR analytics project. I examined attrition patterns within HR, R&D, and
Sales departments, uncovering department-specific factors influencing turnover.
The positive outcome includes a more informed and strategic approach to workforce management,
fostering a more inclusive workplace and contributing to improved overall employee satisfaction and
stability.
